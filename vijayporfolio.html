                    <P class="text-align text-6 text-start">HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React.js are key technologies for web development. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of any webpage, providing the structure and content such as headings, text, images, and links. 
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format that structure by controlling colors, fonts, layouts,and overall design, making websites visually appealing. 
                        Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that offers pre-designed components like buttons, navigation bars, responsive grid systems, helping developers build mobile-friendly websites quickly without writing too much custom CSS. 
                        React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces using reusable components, often used in modern single-page applications 
                        (SPAs) to deliver fast and smooth user experiences Together, these technologies form the base for building attractive, responsive, and interactive websites its are very importantfor attractive website.</P>

                    <p>.NET,JAVA(basic)</p>
                    <P class="text-5">.NET and Java are both powerful platforms used for building software applications. .NET, developed by Microsoft, is a framework mainly used for building web, desktop, and mobile applications, and it supports multiple languages like C#, VB.NET, and F#. 
                        It provides strong integration with Windows, rich libraries, and tools like Visual Studio, making development faster and easier. Java, developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), is a widely used, platform-independent programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
                        It is popular for enterprise applications, Android development, and large-scale systems due to its portability, scalability, and security. Both .NET and Java are widely used in the software industry for developing robust, secure, and scalable applications.</P>

                    <P>MYSQL</P>
                    <P class="text-start">MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used to store, organize, and manage data. It works with tables, rows, and columns and uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to perform operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data. 
                        MySQL is known for being fast, reliable, and easy to use, making it popular for web applications,especially its useful for datastore 
                        when combined with PHP, HTML, and other technologies. It is often used in platforms like WordPress,and e-commerce websites to handle large amounts of data efficiently.</P>
